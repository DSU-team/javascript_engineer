  * Work with SQL and NoSQL databases (considering the necessity of future scaling);

Literally - years are planned ahead.
 
You will be working closely with the best engineers in town enjoying all the benefits of product development. We encourage initiative, creative and proactive approach and fully support our talents on all the levels.
And by saying that we really mean that.
